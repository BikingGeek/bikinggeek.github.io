## The Oldie But Goodie

The **Garmin Edge 500** might be considered vintage in the fast-paced world of bike computers, but it still holds its own among the newer models. Launched in 2009, this little device was ahead of its time, offering features that were cutting edge for its day.

### Key Features

- **Performance Metrics:** This device can track a variety of metrics, including speed, distance, time, elevation, and heart rate (with a compatible monitor). It's like having your own personal coach, minus the yelling.

- **Battery Life:** With up to 18 hours of battery life, the Edge 500 can handle your longest rides. Perfect for those epic bike tours or just a casual Sunday ride that turns into a marathon.
