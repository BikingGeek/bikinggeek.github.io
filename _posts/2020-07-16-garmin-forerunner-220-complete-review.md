**Ready to run down memory lane?**

Whether you choose the Forerunner 220 for its unbeatable value, a modern Forerunner for advanced metrics, or something in between, the most important thing is getting out the door and running. Because no watchâ€”vintage or cutting-edgeâ€”can run those miles for you.

**Now lace up those shoes and show the roads what you're made of.**

**Happy running, fellow geeks!**
