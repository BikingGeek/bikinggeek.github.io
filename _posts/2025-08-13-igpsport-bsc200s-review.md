Are you searching for a GPS bike computer that delivers professional features without the premium price tag? After extensively testing the **iGPSPORT BSC200S**, I can confidently say this $80-120 device offers what the legendary [Garmin Edge 500]({% post_url 2013-01-14-garmin-edge-500-vs-edge-520-review-why-should-stay-with-edge-500 %}) provided in its heyday - solid cycling computer functionality for amateur cyclists at a reasonable price.

The BSC200S reminds me of the **Garmin Edge 130** in terms of target audience, but with significant improvements in screen readability, battery life, and navigation capabilities. For cyclists who want reliable GPS tracking, route following, and comprehensive data recording without spending $200-300 on premium units, this device deserves serious consideration.

## What Makes the iGPSPORT BSC200S Special?

The **iGPSPORT BSC200S** is a wireless GPS bike computer that successfully bridges the gap between basic speed/cadence computers and expensive premium models. Unlike simple cycling computers, this device offers true GPS tracking with **GPX route following capability** - a feature that was once exclusive to high-end units.

### Key Specifications

- **Screen**: 2.4-inch color display with automatic backlight
- **Battery Life**: 25-30 hours (double the Garmin Edge 130's 15 hours)
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth 5.0 and ANT+ for sensor integration
- **Navigation**: Turn-by-turn route guidance (warns 200m before turns)
- **Sensors**: GPS, barometric altimeter, accelerometer, thermometer
- **Price**: $80-120 (significantly less than comparable Garmin units)

The device connects to various sensors measuring speed, cadence, heart rate, power, altitude, and temperature. Most importantly for amateur cyclists, it can **follow pre-loaded GPX routes** without requiring detailed maps, making it perfect for exploring new areas or following training plans.

After using the BSC200S extensively and analyzing feedback from hundreds of users, including several who've upgraded from [Garmin Edge 500 and Edge 130 units]({% post_url 2013-01-14-garmin-edge-500-vs-edge-520-review-why-should-stay-with-edge-500 %}), clear patterns emerge about this device's performance.

One experienced cyclist who owned both the Edge 500 and Edge 130 noted: *"After using the BSC200 for a year and over 4,000 miles of riding, I can say that the $80 BSC200 is pretty good in comparison to the $250 Garmin units."* This sentiment reflects the core value proposition of the BSC200S.

### GPS Navigation and Route Following

[![iGPSPORT BSC200S GPS Navigation](https://i.imgur.com/1syU6R1m.png){:.align-right}]({{ site.constants.wsib }}igpsport-bsc200s)

The BSC200S's standout feature is its **GPS route navigation capability**. Unlike basic bike computers that only show breadcrumb trails, this device provides turn-by-turn guidance, warning you 200 meters before each turn. While it doesn't include detailed maps like premium units, it excels at following pre-loaded GPX routes.

As one user explained: *"It's quite easy to plan your route using any online app like Garmin Connect, download a GPX file, email it to your phone, and upload to the unit. This gives you the best of all worlds: a very inexpensive GPS with the best online mapping tools."*

The navigation system works best with routes that avoid complex intersections or self-crossing paths, as the software can occasionally get confused at crossing points.

## The Complete Picture: Strengths and Limitations

### Outstanding Performance Areas

- **Exceptional Battery Life**: 25-30 hours of actual use (compared to Edge 130's 15 hours and Edge 500's even shorter life)
- **Superior Display**: 2.4-inch color screen with auto backlight beats the Edge 130's tiny monochrome display
- **Data Accuracy**: Measurements exported to [Strava]({% post_url 2013-09-30-strava-vs-garmin-connect-review-of-best-track-analyzers %}) match perfectly with device readings
- **Intuitive Interface**: Six functional buttons eliminate the need to memorize complex button combinations
- **Comprehensive Customization**: Eight pre-configured screens, all fully customizable
- **Sensor Integration**: Seamless ANT+ and Bluetooth connectivity with heart rate monitors, power meters, and smart trainers

### Areas for Improvement

- **Screen Resolution**: 240x320 resolution adequate but not crisp by modern standards
- **GPS Acquisition**: Takes a few extra seconds to lock onto satellites compared to premium units
- **Temperature Sensor**: Reads approximately 4°F lower than actual temperature
- **Build Quality**: Plastic construction feels less premium than Garmin alternatives
- **App Polish**: iGPSPORT app functional but lacks the refinement of Garmin Connect

## Performance Comparison: BSC200S vs. Garmin Competition

Let's examine how the BSC200S stacks up against key competitors:

### vs. Garmin Edge 130 Plus

The Edge 130 comparison is particularly relevant since both target amateur cyclists. The BSC200S offers several clear advantages:

- **Screen**: 2.4" color display vs. Edge 130's 1.8" monochrome screen

- **Navigation**: Turn-by-turn directions vs. basic breadcrumb trail
- **Price**: $80-120 vs. $200+

As one user put it: *"The 2.5-inch screen with auto backlight is way easier to read than the smaller, monochrome display on the Garmin Edge 130. Navigation is also a big plus—turn-by-turn directions make following routes much simpler."*

### vs. Original Garmin Edge 500
