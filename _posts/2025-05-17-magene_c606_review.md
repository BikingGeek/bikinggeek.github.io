## Introduction

Welcome, fellow bike enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the world of GPS bike computers, specifically the **Magene C606**. This little gadget promises to be a game-changer for cyclists who don't want to break the bank but still want some nifty features to enhance their rides. So, grab your helmets and let's hit the review trail!

## First Impressions

Upon unboxing the Magene C606, I was greeted by a sleek and compact design. It's not as flashy as some of its higher-end competitors, but it has a certain charm. The screen is big, clear and easy to read - even for those of us who might need to squint a bit. It feels sturdy enough to handle the bumps and bruises of serious cycling without falling apart, and it's waterproof (IPX7), so it can handle rainy rides—though it won't stop you from complaining about the weather.

One notable feature is its **compatibility with Garmin mounts**. If you've already invested in a Garmin mount, you won't need to buy a new one, which is a nice touch for those upgrading from other devices.

## Features and Functionality

### GPS Navigation

The Magene C606 comes equipped with GPS navigation that's surprisingly accurate for its price. Loading routes is a breeze, and it opens up a world of possibilities for adventurous cyclists. I've tested it on various terrains, and it has consistently provided timely and precise turn-by-turn instructions. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done. Transferring routes from Komoot works seamlessly, which is a handy feature for those who love planning their rides in advance.

### Customizable Data Screens

One of the standout features is the ability to customize the data screens. Whether you're interested in tracking your speed, cadence, heart rate, or even the number of squirrels you pass, you can set it all up. The heart rate monitor syncs seamlessly, and the device is compatible with both speed and cadence sensors.

### Training Plans

For those serious about their cycling workouts, the Magene C606 allows you to download or create tailored training plans. It helps you stay on track with your workouts and automatically advances through each phase. No need for external timers or smartphones; the Magene C606 has it all covered.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Affordable Price**: At under $100, it's a steal for the features it offers, giving you functions of devices that cost hundreds of dollars more.
- **GPS Accuracy**: Reliable navigation for a budget model that gets the job done.
- **Customizable Screens**: Tailor your display to show the information you care about most. Want to track your speed, cadence, heart rate, and the number of squirrels you pass on your ride? You can set it all up (well, maybe not the squirrels).
- **Training Features**: Supports various training plans for serious athletes, allowing you to download or create tailored workouts.
- **Garmin Mount Compatibility**: Works with existing Garmin mounts, saving you money on accessories.
- **Waterproof**: IPX7 rating means it can handle rainy rides without issues.

### Cons

- **Button Layout**: Not the most intuitive, takes some getting used to. They're not intuitive, and using them feels like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while riding a bike. The lack of a touchscreen is understandable at this price point, but the button layout could definitely use some love.
- **App Experience**: The accompanying app feels a bit clunky and could use some improvement. It's still clunky and feels like it was designed as an afterthought. And if you're in the U.S., prepare to embrace the metric system because the app stubbornly refuses to switch to imperial units.
- **Basic Mount**: The included mount is flimsy and feels like an afterthought; consider investing in a more robust one or use a Garmin-compatible mount.
- **Poor Instructions**: Setting up the device feels like a scavenger hunt due to lack of clear instructions.
- **Strava Integration**: Uploading activities to Strava can be an adventure during initial setup, though it works fine once configured.

## Comparison with Other Models

### [Garmin Edge 530]({%- post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying -%})

The Garmin Edge 530 offers advanced training features, better navigation, and a more polished app experience. However, it comes at a significantly higher price point. If you're serious about cycling and have the budget, it's worth considering.

### [Garmin Edge 540]({%- post_url 2023-07-06-garmin-edge-540-review -%})

The Edge 540 adds solar charging and enhanced navigation features, making it a premium choice for serious cyclists. It's a fantastic option if you're willing to splurge.

### [iGPSPORT IGS630]({%- post_url 2023-03-26-igpsport-igs630-review-great-value-bike-computer-minor-flaws -%})

The iGPSPORT IGS630 is a budget-friendly bike computer with solid features and minor flaws. It's accurate, affordable, and gets the job done. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve and some minor frustrations along the way.

### [iGPSPORT BSC300]({%- post_url 2023-06-27-igpsport-bsc300-review-smart-affordable-bike-sensor -%})

The BSC300 is a more affordable alternative within the iGPSPORT lineup. While it lacks some of the advanced features of the iGS630, it's a great entry-level option for casual riders.

## Conclusion

So, is the Magene C606 worth it? Absolutely! If you're looking for a budget-friendly GPS bike computer with solid features and can tolerate a few quirks, the answer is yes. It's accurate, affordable, and gets the job done. Sure, it has a few minor frustrations, but for the price, it's hard to complain.

At the time of writing this review, the Magene C606 is priced at around $99.99 on Amazon. I would recommend purchasing a separate mount for this, which should cost around $15, as the included mount feels like an afterthought. Even with the extra mount, this is still an exceptional price for a full-color bike computer with so many features.

In conclusion, the Magene C606 is a great option for those who want a GPS bike computer without breaking the bank. It gives you the functions of a unit that costs much more—just with a few quirks to keep things interesting.
