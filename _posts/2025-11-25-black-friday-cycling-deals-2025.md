## The Shopping Strategy

### Priority Ranking (Budget Limited)

If you can't buy everything, prioritize:

**Tier 1 - Essential Safety:**

1. [Bike lights]({% post_url 2025-10-08-budget-bike-lights-comparison-2025 %}) (front + rear)
2. Helmet (MIPS preferred)
3. Winter gloves

**Tier 2 - Performance:** 4. Bike computer (if you don't have one) 5. Winter jacket or thermal layers 6. Power meter (if training seriously)

**Tier 3 - Convenience:** 7. Smart trainer (winter training) 8. Tools and maintenance equipment 9. Bags and accessories

**Tier 4 - Nice to Have:** 10. Action camera 11. Premium clothing upgrades 12. Additional sensors

### When to Buy

**NOW (Black Friday):**

- Big ticket items (bike computers, trainers, power meters)
- Premium clothing (Castelli, Assos, etc.)
- Brand name accessories

**Cyber Monday (Nov 28):**

- Online-exclusive deals
- Sometimes even better prices
- Tech accessories

**Throughout November:**

- Watch price fluctuations
- Some deals start early/end early
- Use price tracking tools

**December (After Black Friday):**

- Some deals continue
- Different products on sale
- Holiday-specific deals

### Deal Verification Tips

**Check price history:**

- Use CamelCamelCamel for Amazon
- Check manufacturer's website prices
- Compare multiple retailers

**Beware fake discounts:**

- "50% off" might be fake MSRP
- Check reviews and ratings
- Verify seller reputation

**Calculate true savings:**

- Include shipping costs
- Consider return policies
- Factor in tax

## The Items Worth Full Price

Not everything needs to be on sale! Some items hold value:

**Worth full price:**

- Bike frames/complete bikes (rarely significant discounts)
- Custom-fit items (saddles, shoes if needed NOW)
- Emergency replacements (broken equipment)

**Wait for sales:**

- Clothing (always goes on sale)
- Accessories (frequently discounted)
- Previous-gen electronics (better deals later)

## Deals to AVOID

### Red Flags

**Skip these "deals":**

- Unknown Chinese brands with "90% off"
- Products with no reviews or all fake reviews
- "Limited time" deals that repeat weekly
- Bundles of low-quality items
- Heavily advertised "deal of the century"

**Quality over savings:**
Better to buy one quality item at 20% off than five garbage items at "80% off"!

## The Reality Check

### Do You NEED It?

Before buying, ask yourself:

- Will I actually use this?
- Do I already have something similar?
- Is this solving a real problem?
- Would I buy this at full price?

**The 20% rule:**
If it's not at least 20% off, it's probably not worth calling a "deal." And if you wouldn't buy it at 80% of full price, you don't need it at "50% off" either!

### My Black Friday Picks

If I had $500 to spend:

**Option A - The Trainer Setup ($500):**

- Tacx Flux S trainer - $599... wait that's over budget!
- Okay, Elite Suito - $549... still over!
- Fine, Wahoo KICKR Core - $699... I'm bad at budgets! 😂

**Option A (for real) - The Tech Upgrade ($499):**

- Garmin Edge 1040 - $499
- Done! One big purchase that lasts years.

**Option B - The Complete Winter Setup ($485):**

- Garmin Edge 530 - $249
- Castelli Perfetto RoS Jacket - $159
- Quality winter gloves - $52
- Shoe covers - $45
- Total: $505 (close enough!)

**Option C - The Smart Value ($480):**

- Castelli Sorpasso bibs - $140
- Bontrager Flare RT rear light - $42
- Cygolite front light - $42
- Winter gloves - $52
- Total: $505

## Final Black Friday Tips

**Before shopping:**
✅ Make a list of needs vs wants 
✅ Set a budget and STICK TO IT 
✅ Research products beforehand 
✅ Check return policies 
✅ Sign up for email alerts from favorite brands

**While shopping:**
✅ Compare prices across retailers 
✅ Read recent reviews 
✅ Check shipping costs and times 
✅ Screenshot prices for price-match later 
✅ Use credit cards with purchase protection

**After shopping:**
✅ Track packages 
✅ Test items immediately (return window!) 
✅ Keep receipts and order confirmations 
✅ Leave honest reviews 
✅ Enjoy your new gear! 🎉

## The Bottom Line

Black Friday 2025 has some genuinely EXCELLENT deals on cycling gear! The $100 discounts on premium bike computers (Garmin Edge 1040, Edge 540, Wahoo ROAM v2) are the standout deals this year. Winter clothing from Castelli and Pearl Izumi at 30-40% off is also fantastic value.

**Top 5 deals overall:**

1. **Garmin Edge 1040** - $499 (best premium computer deal)
2. **Wahoo ELEMNT ROAM v2** - $499 (best reliability deal)
3. **Garmin Edge 530** - $249 (best value deal)
4. **Castelli Perfetto RoS Jacket** - $159 (best clothing deal)
5. **Wahoo KICKR Core** - $699 (best trainer deal)

Don't let FOMO (fear of missing out) drive purchases you'll regret! Buy what you'll actually use, prioritize safety and performance items, and save the "nice to have" stuff for when budget allows.

**Pro Tip:** Set a firm budget BEFORE you start shopping. Black Friday psychology makes it easy to spend way more than intended. Having a $300 budget? Pick your items ahead of time, buy those, then STOP. Don't keep browsing "just to see" - that's how budgets die! 💀💸
